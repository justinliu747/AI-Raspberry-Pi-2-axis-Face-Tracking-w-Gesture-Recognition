ðŸ“¹ Real-Time Face Tracking & Gesture Recognition Camera (Raspberry Pi 4)

A smart lecture-recording tool built on Raspberry Pi 4 that automatically tracks a professorâ€™s movement and responds to hand gestures for controls like start/stop recording and marking key moments.

ðŸ”§ Tech stack

MediaPipe â†’ real-time face & hand landmark detection

PyTorch â†’ custom MLP trained on a 2k+ self-collected gesture dataset

OpenCV â†’ frame handling, overlays, threaded video recording

Picamera2 / libcamera â†’ dual-channel ISP for high-res display + low-res inference

âš¡ Optimizations

Multithreaded pipeline for face detection, hand tracking & servo control

Efficient PiCamera2 capture + memory management

Threaded video writer for smooth, drop-free recording

ðŸ“š Key Learnings

Integrated computer vision + embedded ML + systems design

Collected & trained on a custom dataset, deployed on-device

Proved that with smart optimizations, a Raspberry Pi can run real-time AI workloads for education and automation
